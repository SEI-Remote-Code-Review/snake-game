# Snake

A good old classic Snake game with a bit of a personal design.

The main objective of the game is to feed the snake with food particles that are found at random positions. Each food eaten increases the length of the snake and its speed. The player loses if the snake hits its tail or the edges of the game area.

So crawl around, eat delicious cherries (that's what they have on the menu here), and try not to hit yourself or the board walls. Or... just crawl around! Who said you canâ€™t make your own rules? (Watch out for the walls, though) Of course, have fun!
